# SpaceTruss

Name : Anshul Bahukhandi
- This program is used to solve and Analyze space truss (3 Dimensional trusses)
- This was done as a part of coursework(CEE 532) at Arizona state university
- All libraries files and skeleton code was provided buy Mr. S.D Rajan and the 
  project was completed by me.
- Please seek Mr Rajan's or my permission before copying/using/modifying the 
  code anywhere for any use.
- If you need help understanding the code and how it works , feel free to 
  contact me at anshulbahukhandi@gmail.com. I'll be more than glad to help you.
- In a nutshell this code has the capability to read the 3 dimensional truss
  geometry from the text file  , solve the truss for user requirements and 
  print the output in a text file.
